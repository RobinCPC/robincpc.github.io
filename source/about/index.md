### **Chien-Pin Chen**

I am interested in Robotics, Software development, and Self-driving Car.  I was an engineer at Robotic Control Department of Precision Machinery Research Development Center in Taiwan. I am working on developing kinematic algorithms of the industrial robot arm and CAD-Based Application. I also a member of the team focus on developing software controller of the industrial robot.



### Work Experience
