### Robotic eye Mechanism Design

Working as a research assistant in National Taiwan University (NTU), I worked on the project of developing a humanoid robotic eye.

- Design a humanoid robotic eye mechanism with SolidWorks and use laser cutting machine to produce mechanical parts.
- Assemble mechanical parts with RC motors, gears, and CCD into an eye mechanism.
