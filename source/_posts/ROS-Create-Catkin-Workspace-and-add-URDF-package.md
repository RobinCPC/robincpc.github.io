This is my note for learning ROS (Robot Operating System).  

It is just some step I used to create Catkin Workspace and, then, I followed the tutorial in ros.org to create the URDF package of PMC 6-axis robot arm.  
In the following video, I use RViz to demonstrate the virtual robot arm of the URDF package I created.
